  - I've registered in Cyfrin Updraft and begun [Solidity101 course](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/solidity/simple-storage/solidity-arrays-and-structs). I've completed Section_1.
  - I've joined Cyfrin Discord

26/02/2025
  - I've completed section_2 and ended with section_3 6.quiz
  - I've used grok to brainstorm an EV charging payment app

28/02/2025
  - I'm Dabbling into the foundry101 course on Cyfrin updraft to familirize and know the difference between Hardhat and Foundry
  - I've read through HardHat documentation

01/03/2025
  - I've set up Metamask (hh localhost), spun up hh node and imported 3 accounts into Metamask
  - I've set the Sepolia network in the project and a throw away account with 0.5 sepolia ETH
  - Building confidence: I'm going through the JavaScript and Solidity training at Alchemy university
02/03/2025
  -  I've practiced JavaScript problems on Alchemy university, used Grok and MDM documentation for help
      -> I've realized that I know the basics and need to begin to solve simple problems/create simple smart contracts and deploy them
     
### I've written up some dApp Ideas:
1) EV charger app
2) Automatic liquidity removal and creation of a new range (wstETH/ETH) [No IL, stable APR from trading and staking]
3) NFT representing a digital media (rights to download a videogame, movie, music)
4) Single sided AMM (big project)
