# Learning-Solidity-2.0
This is my second run in learning smart contract programming. First run begun in August 2023 until November 2023 (see HTML-CSS-React repository [README](https://github.com/Azshken/HTML-CSS-React)).
Predispositions: 
- Finished Alchemy University JavaScript, Solidity [courses](https://www.alchemy.com/university/courses).
- Went through FCC Node.js course and other JavaScript courses on youtube
- Finished the 32h [freeCodeCamp course on Blockchain, solidity, java](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ).
- Finished [BuidlGuidl](https://buidlguidl.com/) speedrun Ethereum. 1 and 1/2 year ago - I've forgot everything

Motivation: I have a DeFi project in my mind/paper that I'd like to realize. Leter get employed and be a full time developer.

The plan:
1) Relearn Solidity basics.
2) VS code project dependecies installation and project inicialization.
    - decide to use HardHat or Foundry
3) Begin coding small parts (learn Uniswap, Bancor).
   - upload on github
